# Arduino Code  
A collection of critical Arduino code



Have you ever moved PC's and needed to back up your Arduino code? It's a necessary
step when considering which files to move, but often it is overlooked. When this
happens, several things can occur:
- Code is lost forever
- Hair is pulled out
- Families can fall apart

To avoid this, we recommend performing backups, such as this repository. That way,
you won't lose access to the important things in life, such as:
- `base` (cool stuff)
- `break_sensor` (breakbeam sensor code)
- `hc12` (including the help link)
- `joystick_servos` (including the 'stuff' from 'my pc')
- `laser` (and laser code)

and last, but not least:
- `tempF` (for all of your updates)

We hope you find this repository useful, and inspiring for creating your own Arduino
code backup repository!
